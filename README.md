## Project Outline
Welcome to Burger Bistro!

Our program is a web application called "Burger Bistro". Once the program is opened, users will have the option to make a reservation to obtain high-class burgers at our restaurant. If they can't afford them, they can order from the regular menu where the majority of our food items will display at an affordable price. They have the option to order online or stop by our nearby locations. If you order online, you can view your transaction history and even be eligible to gain points as part of our rewards program. 

The purpose of this project is to make ordering from our restaurant a lot more convenient for customers. It also gives customers a chance to look at the menu beforehand before they place an order or show up at the restaurant.
